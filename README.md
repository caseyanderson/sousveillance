[Sousveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sousveillance), a term coined by [Steve Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Mann), defines itself as bringing the camera down to human level, the opposite of surveillance which is always watching from above. We will be creating our own sousveillance-oriented video recording apparatus (designed around the [Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) development environment) and venture throughout Echo Park, searching for public-capturing surveillance equipment installed throughout the neighborhood.

Following deployment, weâ€™ll assemble an ad hoc multi-channel video installation of the sousveillance recordings.

Bring a laptop if you have one!
